# Weather Vane

A simple weather app which gets the users location on load and displays the current weather for that location, as well as a basic forecast for the next week.

The user can then search for a new location, and the app will gather the relevant latitude and longitude from the input location and update the display for the new location.

Users can also choose between metric, imperial and scientific measurements.
